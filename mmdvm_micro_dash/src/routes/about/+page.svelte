<h1>About mmdvm_micro_dash</h1>
<p>Visit <a target="about:blank" href="https://git.sr.ht/~tarxvf/mmdvm_micro_dash">the repo</a> to read the code and documentation</p>
<p>The intent of this project is to provide a minimalist, extensible,
and most importantly easy-to-understand dashboard for the MMDVM
platform. Competing (and much more featureful) dashboards include
Pi-star and W0CHP's fork of it, among a handful of others.</p>
<p>I looked at all of them and while I've
benefited from them greatly, found integrating any of them into <a
href="https://git.sr.ht/~tarxvf/pim17" target="about:blank">pim17</a>
a daunting task for a number of reasons - chief among them my intent to
support lower-power devices. None at the time of writing supported
the newer MQTT features of MMDVM which promise to aid dramatically in
avoiding the log reading problem, so here we are.</p>
